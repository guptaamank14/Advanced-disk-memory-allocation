# Advanced-disk-memory-allocation
1.Project Overview 
The Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator project endeavours to create a sophisticated 
software application that meticulously replicates the behaviour of diverse disk scheduling 
algorithms within a simulated environment. This project transcends a mere 
demonstration, aiming to provide a comprehensive platform for understanding and 
analyzing the intricacies of disk head movement and request servicing. The core 
functionality revolves around enabling users to define custom disk request sequences, 
effectively mimicking real-world scenarios. Users gain granular control over crucial disk 
parameters, including the total number of cylinders, the initial head position, and the 
simulated speed of head movement, allowing for tailored experiments. The simulator will 
then process these requests using a range of established algorithms, such as First-Come, 
First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, Circular SCAN (C
SCAN), LOOK, and Circular LOOK (C-LOOK), among others. 
A critical aspect of this project is the emphasis on visual representation. The simulator 
will feature intuitive graphical interfaces that dynamically illustrate the disk head's 
trajectory across the cylinders, providing a clear visual understanding of each algorithm's 
operational characteristics. Beyond visualization, the simulator will precisely track and 
calculate performance metrics, including total seek time, average waiting time, and 
throughput. These metrics will be presented in a user-friendly format, facilitating direct 
comparison between different algorithms under identical workloads. Furthermore, the 
project aims to incorporate features for generating detailed reports and exporting data, 
enabling users to conduct in-depth analyses and draw meaningful conclusions about the 
efficiency and effectiveness of various scheduling strategies. Ultimately, this project 
seeks to serve as an invaluable educational tool for students and professionals alike, 
fostering a deeper understanding of disk scheduling principles and empowering them to 
make informed decisions regarding storage system optimization.
